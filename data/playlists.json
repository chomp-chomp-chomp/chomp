    "description": "Country anthems, Broadway sincerity, rap chaos, power ballads, bangerz, and absolute nonsense play in sequence because that is how confidence sounds when it stops explaining itself. Baking happens at the same volume. The oven is on. Taste is suspended. Chad Powers does not wait for proof, and neither does dough. These are the songs from Chad Powers. Not inspired by it. Not adjacent to it. Literally the soundtrack, lifted whole and dropped onto the counter while something bakes. Go Fish.",

The dough will rise. There is no drama in competence, only repetition refined into confidence.",

Music plays louder than necessary, as if volume alone might impose order. This is not self-care; it is endurance with flour. Repetition is mistaken for control, control for meaning. The counter becomes a work surface, then a stage, then a minor battlefield. If something burns, it was always part of the plan.",
