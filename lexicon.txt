Term: Alienation
Type: Concept
Description: Separation between labor and enjoyment. The baker often works hardest at the moment they cannot yet consume, producing pleasure that belongs briefly to others.
Image:

Term: All-purpose flour
Type: Ingredient
Description: Standard wheat flour with moderate protein. Its neutrality is ideological: presented as universal, it quietly enforces a norm.
Image:

Term: Almond flour
Type: Ingredient
Description: Finely ground almonds used in place of wheat flour. Almond flour signals substitution as ideology: absence reframed as virtue.
Image:

Term: Blind baking
Type: Technique
Description: Pre-baking a crust before filling. This is preparation without content, form insisting on its autonomy before meaning arrives.

Term: Bread flour
Type: Ingredient
Description: High-protein flour for strength and chew. Structure demands sacrifice; elasticity is born from constraint.
Image:

Term: Brown sugar
Type: Ingredient
Description: Sugar with added molasses. Brown sugar admits residue, flavor emerging from what refinement tried to remove.
Image:

Term: Butterfat
Type: Ingredient
Description: The fat content of butter or dairy. Butterfat is enjoyment quantified, pleasure measured and standardized.
Image:

Term: Cake flour
Type: Ingredient
Description: Low-protein flour for tender crumb. Tenderness here is engineered fragility, softness achieved through deliberate subtraction.
Image:

Term: Contradiction
Type: Concept
Description: The coexistence of opposing truths within the same object. A baked good is both fragile and stable, ephemeral and repeatable, indulgent and ritualized.
Image: https://res.cloudinary.com/dlqfyv1qj/image/upload/images/Contradiction.JPG

Term: Creaming
Type: Technique
Description: Beating butter and sugar together to incorporate air. What appears as simple mixing is in fact the violent reconciliation of fat and crystal, where pleasure is aerated through disciplined force.
Image:

Term: Crumb coat
Type: Technique
Description: A thin initial frosting layer to trap crumbs. The crumb coat functions as ideology: an imperfect first layer that hides the mess necessary for a polished surface.
Image: https://res.cloudinary.com/dlqfyv1qj/image/upload/images/Crumb%20coat.jpg

Term: Cultured butter
Type: Ingredient
Description: Butter made from fermented cream. Time here becomes flavor, decay transformed into refinement.
Image:

Term: Dialectic
Type: Concept
Description: The process by which opposing elements are held in tension to produce something new. Baking is dialectical because raw and cooked, order and decay, pleasure and discipline are not eliminated but transformed through heat.
Image:

Term: Docking
Type: Technique
Description: Pricking dough to prevent bubbles during baking. Docking is preemptive sabotage, a reminder that unchecked expansion leads not to liberation but collapse.
Image:

Term: Egg wash
Type: Technique
Description: Beaten egg brushed on dough for shine and color. Egg wash is pure appearance, proof that surface matters even when substance is unchanged.
Image: https://res.cloudinary.com/dlqfyv1qj/image/upload/images/Egg%20wash.jpg

Term: Emulsifier
Type: Ingredient
Description: Ingredient that binds fat and water. The emulsifier is the mediator, preventing antagonistic elements from separating into open conflict.
Image: https://res.cloudinary.com/dlqfyv1qj/image/upload/images/Emulsifier.jpg

Term: Enjoyment (Jouissance)
Type: Concept
Description: Pleasure that exceeds comfort and becomes almost uncomfortable. Baking promises enjoyment not just in eating, but in the obsessive precision and delayed gratification of the process itself.
Image:

Term: Excess
Type: Concept
Description: That which goes beyond necessity. Baking thrives on excess, because pleasure is never justified by hunger alone.
Image:

Term: Extract
Type: Ingredient
Description: Concentrated flavoring. Extracts promise essence without context, authenticity in miniature.
Image:

Term: Fetish
Type: Concept
Description: An object invested with meaning beyond its material function. A perfect loaf or cookie becomes a fetishized endpoint, concealing the messy labor and failure that produced it.
Image: https://res.cloudinary.com/dlqfyv1qj/image/upload/images/Fetish.JPG

Term: Form and Content
Type: Concept
Description: The distinction between structure and substance. In baking, form often precedes content, as molds, pans, and crusts demand obedience before flavor arrives.
Image:

Term: Granulated sugar
Type: Ingredient
Description: Refined white sugar. Pure sweetness conceals its own violence, the history of refinement erased in crystalline innocence.
Image:

Term: Heavy cream
Type: Ingredient
Description: High-fat dairy used for richness. Excess is not accidental but structural; richness is the point.
Image:

Term: Honey
Type: Ingredient
Description: Natural sweetener with hygroscopic properties. Honey embodies surplus enjoyment, sweetness that refuses to dry out or behave.
Image:

Term: Hydration
Type: Technique
Description: The ratio of liquid to flour in a dough. Hydration measures not abundance but tolerance—how much chaos structure can absorb before dissolving.
Image:

Term: Invert sugar
Type: Ingredient
Description: Liquid sugar that resists crystallization. Stability here is achieved by breakdown, unity preserved through division.
Image:

Term: Lack
Type: Concept
Description: The constitutive absence that drives desire. Baking begins with lack—the missing sweetness, warmth, or comfort that the finished object promises to resolve but never fully does.
Image:

Term: Lamination
Type: Technique
Description: Folding butter into dough to create layers. Here contradiction is preserved rather than resolved: fat and dough remain distinct, yet together produce transcendence.
Image:

Term: Leavening agent
Type: Ingredient
Description: Ingredients that cause dough to rise. Leavening is the promise that emptiness—air, gas, absence—can be productive.
Image:

Term: Materiality
Type: Concept
Description: The insistence that ideas must pass through matter. Baking refuses abstraction; philosophy must be kneaded, measured, and baked to exist.
Image: https://res.cloudinary.com/dlqfyv1qj/image/upload/images/Materiality.JPG

Term: Mediation
Type: Concept
Description: The process by which elements are reconciled through an intervening force. Heat mediates between raw matter and edible form, enforcing transformation without negotiation.
Image:

Term: Molasses
Type: Ingredient
Description: Thick byproduct of sugar refining. Molasses is what capitalism leaves behind: dense, bitter, and oddly indispensable.
Image:

Term: Negation
Type: Concept
Description: The act of defining something by what it is not. Baking negates the raw state of ingredients, and in doing so produces meaning rather than mere destruction.
Image:

Term: Proofing
Type: Technique
Description: Allowing yeast dough to rise before baking. Proofing stages the illusion of freedom: the dough expands on its own, yet only within the strict conditions imposed by temperature and time.
Image: https://res.cloudinary.com/dlqfyv1qj/image/upload/images/Proofing.jpg

Term: Repetition
Type: Concept
Description: The return of the same action under slightly altered conditions. Each bake repeats the last, yet difference insists on emerging through time, temperature, and error.
Image: https://res.cloudinary.com/dlqfyv1qj/image/upload/images/Repetition.JPG

Term: Ritual
Type: Concept
Description: Repeated action invested with meaning beyond utility. Baking rituals transform labor into identity, making repetition feel necessary rather than redundant.
Image: https://res.cloudinary.com/dlqfyv1qj/image/upload/images/Ritual.JPG

Term: Salt
Type: Ingredient
Description: Enhances flavor and controls fermentation. Salt is the negative force that makes meaning possible by withholding excess.
Image:

Term: Seeds & nuts
Type: Ingredient
Description: Ingredients that add texture, fat, and flavor. They interrupt smoothness, insisting that resistance is necessary for interest.
Image: https://res.cloudinary.com/dlqfyv1qj/image/upload/images/Seeds%20and%20nuts.jpg

Term: Shortening
Type: Ingredient
Description: Fat that limits gluten development. Shortening interrupts excessive structure, proving that too much coherence produces toughness, not strength.
Image:

Term: Spice blend
Type: Ingredient
Description: A mixture of warming spices. The blend stages false unity, many voices speaking as one aroma.
Image:

Term: Sublation
Type: Concept
Description: The Hegelian process of canceling and preserving at the same time. Dough is sublated in the oven: it ceases to be dough, yet everything essential to it survives as bread or cake.
Image:

Term: Temporality
Type: Concept
Description: The experience of time as structured and irreversible. Baking exposes time as material: rush it and it fails, wait too long and it collapses.
Image: https://res.cloudinary.com/dlqfyv1qj/image/upload/images/Temporality.JPG

Term: Whole wheat flour
Type: Ingredient
Description: Flour containing bran and germ. Wholeness resists refinement, insisting that nutrition and roughness arrive together.
Image:

Term: Zest
Type: Ingredient
Description: The outer peel of citrus. Zest privileges surface over depth, aroma over substance, and is all the better for it.
Image: https://res.cloudinary.com/dlqfyv1qj/image/upload/images/Zest.jpg
