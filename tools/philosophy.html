            "What we encounter in trauma is not simply a disturbance in the symbolic order, but rather the Real itself erupting, the horrifying kernel around which all signification revolves.",
            "The subject emerges not despite but precisely because of this fundamental gap, this void at the heart of being that cannot be symbolized or integrated into the big Other.",
            "Enjoyment—jouissance—is not something we simply pursue; rather, it is that obscene surplus we cannot rid ourselves of, the stain that marks our symbolic identity.",
            "The pervert, unlike the neurotic, knows very well what the Other wants and dedicates himself to being the instrument of the Other's jouissance.",
            "Capitalism's genius lies in its ability to commodify even its own critique, to package resistance itself as just another lifestyle choice in the cultural supermarket.",
            "The choice between coffee or tea is a false one—what matters is the ideological framework that makes this appear as a meaningful exercise of freedom.",
            "Tolerance today functions as its opposite: the multicultural discourse of tolerance masks the new forms of racism that operate through respect for cultural difference.",
            "The symptom is not something that disturbs the normal functioning of society—rather, society itself is sustained by its symptomatic exceptions and transgressions.",
            "We do not believe in ideology, yet we act as if we do—this gap between belief and behavior is the space where ideology truly operates.",
            "The Real is not reality, but that which resists symbolization absolutely, the traumatic kernel that returns again and again to disrupt our fantasmatic narratives.",
            "Love is not about finding the perfect complement but rather about accepting and even embracing the absolute otherness, the irreducible strangeness of the beloved.",

            "Contradiction is not something to be avoided but is rather the principle of all movement and vitality in the dialectical process.",
